## Problem Statement
Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

## Data
Danny has shared 3 key datasets for this case study:

### **`sales`**

<details>
  <summary>
    View table
  </summary>

  The sales table captures all `customer_id` level purchases with an corresponding `order_date` and `product_id` information for when and what menu items were ordered.

  |customer_id|order_date|product_id|
  |-----------|----------|----------|
  |A          |2021-01-01|1         |
  |A          |2021-01-01|2         |
  |A          |2021-01-07|2         |
  |A          |2021-01-10|3         |
  |A          |2021-01-11|3         |
  |A          |2021-01-11|3         |
  |B          |2021-01-01|2         |
  |B          |2021-01-02|2         |
  |B          |2021-01-04|1         |
  |B          |2021-01-11|1         |
  |B          |2021-01-16|3         |
  |B          |2021-02-01|3         |
  |C          |2021-01-01|3         |
  |C          |2021-01-01|3         |
  |C          |2021-01-07|3         |

</details>

### **`menu`**

<details>
  <summary>
    View table
  </summary>

  The menu table maps the `product_id` to the actual `product_name` and price of each menu item.

  |product_id |product_name|price     |
  |-----------|------------|----------|
  |1          |sushi       |10        |
  |2          |curry       |15        |
  |3          |ramen       |12        |

</details>

### **`members`**

<details>
  <summary>
    View table
  </summary>
  
  The final members table captures the `join_date` when a `customer_id` joined the beta version of the Dannyâ€™s Diner loyalty program.

  |customer_id|join_date   |
  |-----------|----------  |
  |A          | 2021-01-07 |
  |B          | 2021-01-09 |

</details>

## Case Study Questions

<details>
  <summary>
    Click here to view the Case Study Questions!
  </summary>

  - What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
  - How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
  - What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
  - What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
  - Which item was the most popular for each customer?
  - Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
  - Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
  - What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
  - If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
  - In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?

</details>

## Solution

### 1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
```sql
SELECT 
  s.customer_id,
  SUM(m.price) AS amount_spent
FROM dannys_diner.sales s
JOIN dannys_diner.menu m
	ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY customer_id
```

- Use **JOIN** to merge `sales` and `menu` tables as `customer_id` and `price` are present in these tables.
- Find out `total_spent` using **SUM** and then use **GROUP BY** to segregate it by each customer.


#### Result:
| customer_id | total_spent |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| B           | 74          |
| C           | 36          |
| A           | 76          |

***

### 2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
```sql
SELECT
  customer_id,
  COUNT (DISTINCT order_date) AS visited_days
FROM dannys_diner.sales
GROUP BY customer_id;
```
- First, take unique `order_date` with **DISTINCT** and then take **COUNT** to find out the `visited_days` for each customer.

#### Result:
| customer_id | visited_days |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| A           | 4            |
| B           | 6            |
| C           | 2            |

***

### 3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?

```sql
WITH order_cte AS
(
   SELECT customer_id, order_date, product_name,
      DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id
      ORDER BY s.order_date) AS rank
   FROM dannys_diner.sales AS s
   JOIN dannys_diner.menu AS m
      ON s.product_id = m.product_id
)

SELECT customer_id, product_name
FROM order_cte
WHERE rank = 1
```

- First, Create a temp table `order_cte` and use **Windows function** with **DENSE_RANK** to create a new column `rank` based on `order_date`.
- Its better to use **DENSE_RANK** instead of **ROW_NUMBER** or **RANK** as we dont have time in `order_date` to distinguish multiple items bought on same day.
- Finally, **GROUP BY** all columns to show first item only using `rank = 1`.

#### Result:
| customer_id | product_name | 
| ----------- | -----------  |
| A           | curry        | 
| A           | sushi        | 
| B           | curry        | 
| C           | ramen        |

***

### 4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?

```sql
SELECT
  menu.product_name,
  COUNT(sales.product_id) AS most_purchased
FROM dannys_diner.sales
JOIN dannys_diner.menu
  ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY menu.product_name
ORDER BY most_purchased DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

- First, count number of `product_id` using **COUNT** and then sort it by `most_purchased` using **ORDER BY** by desc order. 
- Then, use **LIMIT 1** to filter first item which is the most purchased item.

#### Result:
| product_name | most_purchased |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| ramen        | 8 |

***
### 5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?

```sql
WITH most_popular_cte AS
(  
   SELECT s.customer_id, m.product_name, COUNT(m.product_id) AS order_count,
      DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id
      ORDER BY COUNT(s.customer_id) DESC) AS rank
   FROM dannys_diner.menu AS m
   JOIN dannys_diner.sales AS s
      ON m.product_id = s.product_id
   GROUP BY s.customer_id, m.product_name
)   

SELECT customer_id, product_name, order_count
FROM most_popular_cte 
WHERE rank = 1;
```

- Create a temp table `most_popular_cte` and use **DENSE_RANK** to `rank` the `order_count` for each product by desc order for each customer using **GROUP BY**.
- Filter out the most popular product for each customer using `rank = 1` .

#### Result:
| customer_id | product_name | order_count |
| ----------- | ---------- |-------------  |
| A           | ramen        |  3   |
| B           | sushi        |  2   |
| B           | curry        |  2   |
| B           | ramen        |  2   |
| C           | ramen        |  3   |

***
### 6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?

```sql
WITH member_cte AS 
(
   SELECT s.customer_id, m.join_date, s.order_date, s.product_id,
      DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id
      ORDER BY s.order_date ASC) AS rank
   FROM dannys_diner.sales s
   JOIN dannys_diner.members m
      ON s.customer_id = m.customer_id
   WHERE s.order_date >= m.join_date
)

SELECT s.customer_id, s.order_date, m1.product_name 
FROM member_cte AS s
JOIN dannys_diner.menu AS m1
   ON s.product_id = m1.product_id
WHERE rank = 1
ORDER BY s.customer_id;
```


- Create a temp table `member_cte` by using **windows function** and partitioning `customer_id` by ascending `order_date`. Then, filter `order_date` to be on or after `join_date`.
- Then, use **JOIN** to combine temp table `member_cte` and `menu` table
- Finally filter to get 1st item purchased by each customer using `rank = 1`.

#### Result:
| customer_id | order_date  | product_name |
| ----------- | ---------- |----------  |
| A           | 2021-01-07T00:00:00.000Z | curry |
| B           | 2021-01-11T00:00:00.000Z | sushi |

***

### 7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?

```sql
WITH member_before_cte AS 
(
   SELECT s.customer_id, m.join_date, s.order_date, s.product_id,
      DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id
      ORDER BY s.order_date DESC) AS rank
   FROM dannys_diner.sales s
   JOIN dannys_diner.members m
      ON s.customer_id = m.customer_id
   WHERE s.order_date < m.join_date
)

SELECT s.customer_id, s.order_date, m1.product_name 
FROM member_before_cte AS s
JOIN dannys_diner.menu AS m1
   ON s.product_id = m1.product_id
WHERE rank = 1
ORDER BY s.customer_id;
```

- Create a temp table `member_before_cte` to create new column `rank` by using **DENSE_RANK()** and partitioning by `customer_id` and sort `order_date` in desc order to find out the last order before becoming a member.
- Then, use **JOIN** to combine temp table `member_cte` and `menu` table
- Finally filter to get 1st item purchased by each customer using `rank = 1`.

#### Result:
| customer_id | order_date  | product_name |
| ----------- | ---------- |----------  |
| A           | 2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z |  sushi        |
| A           | 2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z |  curry        |
| B           | 2021-01-04T00:00:00.000Z |  sushi        |

***

### 8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?

```sql
SELECT
 s.customer_id,
 COUNT(s.product_id ) AS total_items,
 SUM(m.price) AS amount_spent
FROM dannys_diner.sales s
JOIN dannys_diner.menu m
 ON m.product_id = s.product_id
JOIN dannys_diner.Members Mem
 ON Mem.Customer_id = s.customer_id
WHERE s.order_date < Mem.join_date
GROUP BY s.customer_id
ORDER BY s.customer_id;
```

- Filter on basis of `order_date` only before `join_date` and perform a **COUNT** on `product_id` to get total items bought before membership 
- Then, use **SUM** to get the total `amount_spent` before membership.

#### Result:
| customer_id | total_items | amount_spent |
| ----------- | ---------- |----------  |
| A           | 2 |  25       |
| B           | 3 |  40       |

***

### 9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier â€” how many points would each customer have?

```sql
WITH points_cte AS
(
   SELECT *, 
      CASE
         WHEN product_name = 'sushi' THEN price * 20
         ELSE price * 10
      END AS points
   FROM dannys_diner.menu
)

SELECT s.customer_id, SUM(p.points) AS points
FROM points_cte p
JOIN dannys_diner.sales s
   ON p.product_id = s.product_id
GROUP BY s.customer_id
ORDER BY s.customer_id;
```

- Each $1 spent = 10 points, Special case 'sushi' gets 2x points, meaning each $1 spent = 20 points
- Hence, use conditional statements CASE WHEN
- If product_name = 'sushi', then every $1 price multiply by 20 points
- All other product_id that is not 1, multiply $1 by 10 points
- Finally, add the `points` using **SUM**.

#### Result:
| customer_id | points | 
| ----------- | ------ |
| A           | 860 |
| B           | 940 |
| C           | 360 |
